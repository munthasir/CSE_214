<!--h2>Brief</h2-->

<p>
<strong>Most programming languages are organized as structured blocks of statements,
with some blocks nested within others. Functions, which are examples of such blocks, 
execute statements and other blocks contained within them. Similarly, flow control 
structures, such as <span class="code">for</span> and <span class="code">while</span> loops, 
are blocks which can be executed several times subject to some condition. The Python 
programming language is an example of a language which follows this principle, and is even 
flexible enough to allow functions to be nested within functions!</strong></p>

<p><strong>In this homework assignment, you will create a code tracer program which takes the name of
a Python file containing a single function and outputs the Big-Oh order of complexity of that
function. To make things easier, several restrictions will be made on the format of the input 
code, and some techniques for text parsing will be described below. You must implement a 
<span class="code">BlockStack</span> class to determine the complexity of blocks with nested blocks, and 
use the rules of Big-Oh complexity to determine the total complexity for the function. You are 
encouraged to use the Java API to help you complete this assignment, but you may implement the
stack however you like.

</strong></p><p><strong><strong>It should be noted that you do not need to actually learn Python to complete this 
assignment - simply following the instructions as detailed in this specification should suffice. 
However, if you would like some background on language, a good starting point would be the Python
<a href="http://www.python.org/">website</a>, which should provide you with enough information to get
a feel for how the language works.</strong></strong></p><strong>

</strong><p></p>

<h2>Required Classes</h2>
<p><strong>The following sections describe classes which are required for this assignment. Each section
provides a description and the specifications necessary to complete each class. If you feel
that additional methods would be useful, you may feel free to add them during your implementation
as you see fit. However, all the variables and methods in the following specifications must be
included in your project.</strong></p>

<h3>1. Complexity</h3>
<p><strong>Write a fully-documented class named <span class="code">Complexity</span>
which represents the Big-Oh complexity of some block of code. Since Big-Oh notation can get quite
messy (<i>e.g. log(n^(1/2) / n!)</i>), we will restrict the possible orders to powers of 
two base types: <span class="code">n</span>, and <span class="code">log_n</span>. Following 
this practice, include two member variables in the <span class="code">Complexity</span> class: 
<span class="code">nPower</span> (int) and <span class="code">logPower</span> (int). These two
variables will keep track of what power each of the base types is present in the complexity
object.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>For example, a Complexity object with <span class="code">nPower= 4</span> and 
<span class="code">logPower = 2</span> would represent the complexity <span class="code">O(n^4 * log(n)^2)</span>. Similarly, a Complexity object with <span class="code">nPower = 1</span> and 
<span class="code">logPower = 1</span> would represent the complexity <span class="code">O(n * log(n))</span> (note that the <span style="color:red">exponents only appear when the power value is 
greater than 1</span>). A case to consider is the situation in which both variables are 0, which 
indicates that the complexity is <span class="code">O(1)</span>.</strong></p> 

<ul><strong>
    <li><span class="code">public Complexity</span> - constructor (you may include a
        constructor with parameters)</li><br>
    <li>Two int member variables: <span class="code">nPower</span> and <span class="code">
        logPower.</span></li><br>
    <li>Getter and setter methods for both member variables.</li><br>
    <li>A toString() method which prints human-readable Big-Oh notation. (e.g 
    <span class="code">O(n^4 * log(n)^2)</span>.</li>
</strong></ul>

<h3>2. CodeBlock</h3>
<p><strong>Write a fully-documented class named <span class="code">CodeBlock</span>
which describes a nested block of code. There are different types of code blocks you must consider 
(<i>e.g. a <span class="code">for</span> block, a <span class="code">while</span> block, 
etc.</i>), so create a static final array of six String variables named <span class="code">
BLOCK_TYPES</span> to enumerate the types of blocks available for nesting. <span class="code">"def", "for",
"while", "if", "elif", "else"</span>.  You should also declare six static final int variables 
corresponding to the indices of the <span class="code">BLOCK_TYPE</span> array: <span class="code">
DEF = 0, FOR = 1, WHILE = 2, IF = 3, ELIF = 4, ELSE = 5</span>.</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:11pt"><strong>
<span style="color:green">NOTE 1</span>: When parsing Python code for the keywords,
be careful not to accidentally parse the "for" in "fortune" (which might be a variable name) as
the start of a <span class="code">for</span> block. To avoid this, make sure there is a single space
(<span class="code">" "</span>) before and after the keyword before starting a new block.
</strong></p>

<p style="font-size:11pt"><strong>
<span style="color:green">NOTE 2</span>: An alternative to the above combination of a single 
static array <span class="code">BLOCK_TYPES</span> and six static final ints representing the
indices is to use a Java <span class="code">
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html">Enum</a></span> type. 
It is not required for this assignment, but you may find it to provide a simpler and more elegant 
solution.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Include a member variable <span class="code">blockComplexity</span> (Complexity) to 
keep track of the Big-Oh complexity of this block, and a member variable <span class="code">
highestSubComplexity</span> (Complexity) to keep track of the Big-Oh complexity of the highest-order 
block nested within this block. The difference between these Complexity objects is that the 
<span class="code">blockComplexity</span> represents the order of the block ignoring the 
statements inside (<i>e.g. <span class="code">O(n)</span> for a <span class="code">while</span> block looping from 
n to 1</i>), whereas the <span class="code">highestSubComplexity</span> represents the highest complexity of
all the blocks nested inside this block.</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Lastly, include two <span class="code">String</span> member variables <span class="code">name</span> and 
<span class="code">loopVariable</span>. The <span class="code">name</span> member will be used to keep track of 
the nested structure of the blocks. The first block in the stack will always be named "1". All blocks included 
directly under a block will be numbered increasingly using a dot "." separator after the block's own name (e.g. 
blocks nested under block 1 will start with "1.1" and proceed to "1.2", "1.3", etc). Similarly, all blocks 
included directly under the block named "1.2" will be numbered "1.2.1", "1.2.2", "1.2.3", etc. For more detail, 
see the sample I/O below.

The <span class="code">loopVariable</span> member will only be used for <span class="code">while</span> blocks
in this assignment, as <span class="code">for</span> blocks will not alter their variable during execution in the
input code. In the constructor, this variable can be initialized to <span class="code">null</span> and should only 
be updated when a <span class="code">while</span> block is traced and the name of it's loop variable has been 
determined. See the sample algorithm below for further information.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Include getter and setter methods for all member variables.</strong></p>

<ul><strong>
    <li><span class="code">public CodeBlock</span> - constructor (you may include a
        constructor with parameters)</li><br>
    <li>A static final array of six String constants <span class="code">BLOCK_TYPES</span>
        representing the types of code blocks:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">public static final String BLOCK_TYPES = {"def", "for",
                "while", "if", "elif", "else"};</span></li>
        </ul><br>
    <li>Six static final int variables corresponding to the indices of the <span class="code">
        BLOCK_TYPES</span> array:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">public static final int DEF = 0, FOR = 1, WHILE = 2, IF = 3, 
                ELIF = 4, ELSE = 5;</span></li>
        </ul><br>
    <li>Two Complexity member variables:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">private Complexity blockComplexity;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">private Complexity highestSubComplexity;</span></li>
        </ul><br></li>
    <font color="red"><li>Two String member variables:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="code">private String name;</span></li>
            <li><span class="code">private String loopVariable;</span></li>
        </ul><br>
    </li></font>
    <li>Getter and setter methods for each member variable.</li>
</strong></ul>

<h3>3. BlockStack (or java.util.Stack)</h3>
<p><strong>
Since the complexity of each <span class="code">CodeBlock</span> depends on the complexity 
of any <span class="code">CodeBlocks</span> nested inside of it (following standard order of 
complexity rules), your tracer will need to use a Stack to determine the total complexity of a 
function. In this assignment, you can write your own Stack class or you may use the standard 
Stack class that is in the java.util package. Go to the HELP section and view the online 
documentation for Stack from the Java API.<br></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:11pt"><strong>
<span style="color:red">CAUTION</span>: Although the Stack class has push, pop and peek methods, the Stack 
class is a subclass of Vector. Therefore, all of the methods of Vector are also accessible in the 
Stack class. However, if you use any of the inherited Vector methods in your solution, you will 
be penalized in this assignment, since some of the Vector methods are not supposed to apply to a 
Stack ADT in general. (That is, the designers of Java basically define that a Stack is a special 
type of Vector, but it really isn't.)
</strong></p>

<h3>4. PythonTracer</h3>
<p><strong>Write a fully-documented class named <span class="code">PythonTracer</span> 
which contains a <span class="code">main</span> method. The class will also contain a static final
int variable <span class="code">SPACE_COUNT = 4</span> which will be used to determine the indentation of
each statement (see below). In addition, include a static <span class="code">traceFile</span> 
method, which will take as a parameter the name of a file containing a Python function. The 
<span class="code">traceFile</span> method will open the indicated file, trace through the code of
the Python function contained within the file, and output the details of the trace and the overall
complexity to the console.</strong></p>

<p><strong>During the operation of the <span class="code">traceFile</span> method, the user should be
updated to the changes being made to the stack via a <i>stack trace</i>. Every time a new block is pushed
on to the stack, the block's name (see the sample I/O for naming convention), complexity, and
highest sub-complexity should be printed to the console. In addition, every time the Complexity at the top 
of the stack is updated, the new values should be printed to the console. Lastly, after a block is popped
from the stack, the new top of the stack should be updated (it's
<span class="code">highestSubComplexity
</span> variable should be changed if necessary), and it should be printed to the console, regardless
of whether it was changed or not. These operations correspond to 'entering' a new block,
determining the complexity of the current block, and 'leaving' a block, respectively. For more detail, 
see the sample I/O below.</strong></p>

<strong><ul>
	<li><span class="code">public static final int SPACE_COUNT = 4;</span></li><br>
    <li><span class="code">public static Complexity traceFile(String filename)</span>
        <ul><br>
            <li><i>Brief:</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>Opens the indicated file and traces through the code of the Python
                    function contained within the file, returning the Big-Oh order of complexity
                    of the function. During operation, the stack trace should be printed to the
                    console as code blocks are pushed to/popped from the stack.
                </li></ul>
            </li><br>

            <li><i>Preconditions:</i>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">filename</span> is not <span class="code">null</span> and 
                    the file it names contains a single Python function with valid syntax (<font color="green">Reminder</font>: you do <b>NOT</b> have to check for invalid syntax).
                </li></ul>
            </li><br>

            <li><i>Returns:</i>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <span class="code">Complexity</span> object representing the total 
                    order of complexity of the Python code contained within the file.
                </li></ul>
            </li><br>

        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><span class="code">public static void main(String[] args)</span>

                    <li>Prompts the user for the name of a file containing a single Python 
                    function, determines its order of complexity, and prints the result to the
                    console.
                </li></ul>
            </li><br>

<h3><i>Trace Algorithm</i></h3>

<h2>Input Code Restrictions</h2>

<p>Instead of enclosing blocks of code within curly braces (as is the case in Java and other C-style
languages), Python delineates blocks of code using whitespace. In Python code, statements in the same
block must have the exact same number of spaces or tabs preceding them. Once a new block is declared
(via a new <span class="code">def, for, while, if, else,</span> or <span class="code">elif</span>), 
all statements contained within the new block must be indented by AT LEAST one additional whitespace character,
whether it be a space (<span class="code">" "</span>) or a tab (<span class="code">"\t"</span>). Once
this new block ends, the following statements must have the exact same indentation as the
previous statements in the block (see the code in <a href="http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~cse214/hw/hw3-images/src/python_example.py">python_example.py</a>
for an extensive example of the syntax).</p>

<p>In this assignment, every instance of <span class="code">def, for, while, if, elif</span> and <span class="code">else</span> contains all following statements that are indented <font style="color:red">
exactly 4 spaces</font> further than the block declaration. Although valid Python code may have any
system of consistent indentation, it is conventional to use 4 spaces or a single tab.
All Python code in this assignment will have 4 spaces as an indentation marker for blocks, which
will be stored in the <span class="code">SPACES_COUNT</span> variable.</p><p>

</p><p>To determine which block a statement is in, count the number of spaces (character ' ') occurring before
the statement, and divide this number by <span class="code">SPACES_COUNT</span>, which is defined in the 
<span class="code">PythonTracer</span> class. If it is equal to the size of the current
<span class="code">BlockStack</span>, it is part of the <span class="code">CodeBlock</span> at the top of 
the stack. If this number is less than the size of the stack, pop <span class="code">CodeBlocks</span> off 
of the stack until its size is equal to this number. If this number is greater than the current size of 
the stack, then it is a syntax error (<span style="color:green">you do not have to check for erroneous 
code in this assignment, all test files will contain valid Python code</span>).</p>

<p>Comments in Python come in two varieties. There are line comments, which start at the first instance
of "#" and continue to the end of the line (similar to "//" comments in Java). There are
also block comments, which start with three consecutive double-quote characters (""") and continue until
the next three consecutive double-quote characters (similar to "/* */" comments in Java). This assignment
will only contain line comments, and all line comments will exist on a single line (there will be no 
comment on the same line as any statement). <span style="color:green">While parsing, you should ignore 
ANY line that contains at least one "#" character</span>.</p>

<p>When a new block is traced, a new <span class="code">CodeBlock</span> object should be created, and
it's <span class="code">blockComplexity</span> variable should be initialized to some value depending
on the block type. All <span class="code">def</span>, <span class="code">if</span>, <span class="code">
elif</span>, and <span class="code">else</span> blocks should have a <span class="code">blockComplexity
</span> of <span class="code">O(1)</span>. However, <span class="code">for</span> blocks and 
<span class="code">while</span> blocks will have varying complexity, and it is up for you to determine
the complexity of the block.</p>

<p>In this assignment, all <span class="code">for</span> blocks will be of the following variety, where 
<span class="code">*</span> represents some variable name:
</p><blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt">
<pre>for * in <span style="color:blue">N</span>                        for * in <span style="color:blue">log_N</span>
                    or
    .  .  .                           .  .  .

</pre>
</blockquote>

The complexity of <span class="code">for</span> blocks iterating <span class="code">*</span> over
<span class="code">N</span> is <span class="code">O(N)</span>. Similarly, the complexity of 
<span class="code">for</span> blocks iterating <span class="code">*</span> over <span class="code">log_N
</span> is <span class="code">O(log(N))</span>.<p></p>

<p>In addition, in this assignment, all <span class="code">while</span> blocks will loop from 
<span class="code">n</span> to <span class="code">1</span> over some variable. Since the complexity of 
<span class="code">while</span> blocks can only be determined by their update statement, the <span class="code">blockComplexity</span> of <span class="code">while</span> blocks should be initialized to 
<span class="code">O(1)</span> and changed after the update statement has been located. The update 
statement will be located within the block and can be either of the following:
</p><blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt">
<pre>* = n                              * = n

while (* &gt; 1)                      while (* &gt; 1)
                       or
    .  .  .                            .  .  .

    <span style="color:blue"><b>* -= 1</b></span>                              <span style="color:blue"><b>* /= 2</b></span>

</pre>
</blockquote>

<span class="code">while</span> blocks which decrement their counter will have an order of complexity of
<span class="code">O(n)</span>, whereas <span class="code">while</span> blocks dividing their counter by
2 will have an order of complexity of <span class="code">O(log(n))</span>.

<blockquote style="margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt">
<pre>FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(<span style="color:blue">fileName</span>);

InputStreamReader inStream = new InputStreamReader(fis);

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(inStream);
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Once
the stream is open, you can read one line at a time as follows:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<pre>String data = reader.readLine();
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You
can also create the reader using a scanner:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Scanner reader = new Scanner(new File(<span style="color:blue">fileName</span>));</pre>

<h2>String Handling Methods/Examples</h2>

<p><b>This homework requires string handling and manipulation. Here are some of the String
class methods that you may need. For a more thorough explanation please refer
to the Java API documentation on Strings <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">here.</a></b></p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="code">char charAt(int index)</span><br>
     Returns the char value at the specified index.</li>
	<li><span class="code">String substring(int beginIndex)</span><br>
     Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.</li>
	<li><span class="code">String substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)</span><br>
     Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.</li>
	<li><span class="code">String trim()</span><br>
     Returns a copy of the string, with leading and trailing whitespace
     omitted.</li>
	<li><span class="code">boolean equals(Object anObject)</span><br>
     Compares this string to the specified object.</li>
	<li><span class="code">boolean equalsIgnoreCase(String anotherString)</span><br>
     Compares this string to the specified string, ignoring case.</li>
	<li><span class="code">int indexOf(String str)</span><br>
     Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the
     specified character.</li>
	<li><span class="code">int length()</span><br>
     Returns the length of this string.</li>
	<li><span class="code">String[] split(String regex)</span><br>
     Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Here are some examples of how you might use some of these methods:

</p><pre>    String testString1 = " This is an example String. "
    String testString2 = "cat"
    
    testString1.charAt(9) //Will return 'a'
    testString1.trim() //Will return “This is an example String.”    
    testString1.substring(5) //returns " is an example String."  
    testString1.substring(5, 9) //returns " is ", note that the endIndex is not included in the returned string
    testString1.substring(5, 9).trim() //returns "is" 
    
    testString2.equals("cat") //returns true
    testString2.equals("bat") //returns false
    
    testString1.indexOf("amp") //returns 14
    testString1.length() //returns 28
    testString2.length() //returns 3
    
    testString1.split(" ") //returns an array of size 5 consisting of "This", "is", "an", "example", and "String."

</pre><p></p>

<p><strong>
String manipulation is a very important programming skill. Try to come up with some clever and elegant
solutions to String parsing using these methods. As an example, a clever way to count the number of leading
spaces in a String is to use a combination of the <span class="code">indexOf()</span> method and the 
<span class="code">trim()</span> method. 

</strong></p><pre><strong>    // 's' contains the line of text to be parsed.
    int space_count = s.indexOf(s.trim());
</strong></pre><strong>
